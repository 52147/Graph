 * = Overview of Depth-First Search Algorithm =
 * 
 * - Previously, we learned how to check the connectivity between 2 vertices with the "disjoint set" data structure.
 * 
 * - Now let's switch gears and consider:
 *   - Given a graph, how can we find all of its vertices, and how can we find all paths between two vertices?
 *   
 *   - The depth-first search algorithm is ideal in solving these kinds of problems
 *     because it can explore all paths from the start vertex to all other vertices.
 *   - Let's start by considering an example.
 *   
 *   - In figure 7, there are five vertices [A, B, C, D, E].
 *   
 *   - Given two vertices A and B, there are 2 path between them.
 *   - One path is [A, C, D, B], and the other is [A, E , B]
 *   
 *       A-C-D
 *       \   /
 *        E-B
